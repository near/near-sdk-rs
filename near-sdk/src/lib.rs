//! # `near-sdk`
//!
//! `near-sdk` is a Rust toolkit for developing smart contracts on the [NEAR blockchain](https://near.org).  
//! It provides abstractions, macros, and utilities to make building robust and secure contracts easy.
//! More information on how to develop smart contracts can be found in the [NEAR documentation](https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/what-is).
//! With near-sdk you can create DeFi applications, NFTs and marketplaces, DAOs, gaming and metaverse apps, and much more.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **State Management:** Simplified handling of contract state with serialization via [Borsh](https://borsh.io) or JSON.
//! - **Initialization methods** We can define an initialization method that can be used to initialize the state of the contract. #\[init\] macro verifies that the contract has not been initialized yet (the contract state doesn't exist) and will panic otherwise.
//! - **Payable methods** We can allow methods to accept token transfer together with the function call with #\[payable\] macro.
//! - **Private methods** #\[private\] macro makes it possible to define private methods that can't be called from the outside of the contract.
//! - **Cross-Contract Calls:** Support for asynchronous interactions between contracts.
//! - **Unit Testing:** Built-in support for testing contracts in a Rust environment.
//! - **WASM Compilation:** Compile Rust code to WebAssembly (WASM) for execution on the NEAR runtime.
//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! Add `near-sdk` to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! near-sdk = "5.6.0"
//! ```
//!
//! ### Example: Counter Smart Contract
//!
//! Below is an example of a simple counter contract that increments and retrieves a value:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use near_sdk::{env, near};
//!
//! #[near(contract_state)]
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! pub struct Counter {
//!     value: i32,
//! }
//!
//! #[near]
//! impl Counter {
//!     /// Increment the counter by one.
//!     pub fn increment(&mut self) {
//!         self.value += 1;
//!         env::log_str(&format!("Counter incremented to: {}", self.value));
//!     }
//!
//!     /// Get the current value of the counter.
//!     pub fn get(&self) -> i32 {
//!         self.value
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Compiling to WASM
//!
//! Install cargo near in case if you don't have it:
//! ```bash
//! cargo install --locked cargo-near
//! ```
//!
//! Build your contract for the NEAR blockchain:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo near build
//! ```
//!
//! ### Running Unit Tests
//!
//! Use the following testing setup:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[cfg(test)]
//! mod tests {
//!     use super::*;
//!
//!     #[test]
//!     fn increment_works() {
//!         let mut counter = Counter::default();
//!         counter.increment();
//!         assert_eq!(counter.get(), 1);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Run tests using:
//! ```bash
//! cargo test
//! ```
