//! Collections and types used when interacting with storage.
//!
//! ## Benchmarks of comparison with [`std::collections`]:
//!
//! To help you understand how cost-effective near collections are in terms of gas usage compared to native ones,
//! take a look at this investigation: [Near benchmarking github](https://github.com/volodymyr-matselyukh/near-benchmarking).
//!
//! The results of the investigation can be found here: [Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ThsBlNR6_Ol9K8cU7BRXNN73PblkTbx0VW_njrF633g/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
//!
//! If your collection has up to 100 entries, it's acceptable to use the native collection, as it might be simpler
//! since you don't have to manage prefixes as we do with near collections.
//! However, if your collection has 1,000 or more entries, it's better to use a near collection. The investigation
//! mentioned above shows that running the contains method on a native [`std::collections::HashSet<i32>`] **consumes 41% more gas**
//! compared to a near [`crate::store::IterableSet<i32>`].
//!
//! ## FAQ: most collections of this [`module`](self) persist on `Drop` and `flush`
//! Unlike containers in [`near_sdk::collections`](crate::collections) module, most containers in current [`module`](self) cache all changes
//! and loads and only update values that are changed in storage after it’s dropped through it’s [`Drop`] implementation.
//! Note that [`LookupSet`](crate::store::LookupSet) is an exception and writes directly to storage on each operation
//! without using an in-memory cache or a `flush`-based persistence mechanism.
//!
//! These changes can be updated in storage before the container variable is dropped by using
//! the container's `flush` method, e.g. [`IterableMap::flush`](crate::store::IterableMap::flush) ([`IterableMap::drop`](crate::store::IterableMap::drop) uses it in implementation too).
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use near_sdk::{log, near};
//! use near_sdk::store::IterableMap;
//!
//! #[near(contract_state)]
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! pub struct Contract {
//!   greeting_map: IterableMap<String, String>,
//! }
//!
//! # impl Default for Contract {
//! #     fn default() -> Self {
//! #         let prefix = b"gr_pr";
//! #         Self {
//! #             greeting_map: IterableMap::new(prefix.as_slice()),
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! # }
//!
//! #[near]
//! impl Contract {
//!     pub fn mutating_method(&mut self, argument: String) {
//!         self.greeting_map.insert("greeting".into(), argument);

//!         near_sdk::env::log_str(&format!("State of contract mutated: {:#?}", self));
//!     }
//! }
//! // expanded #[near] macro call on a contract method definition:
//! // ...
//! # let argument = "hello world".to_string();
//! let mut contract: Contract = ::near_sdk::env::state_read().unwrap_or_default();
//! // call of the original `mutating_method` as defined in source code prior to expansion
//! Contract::mutating_method(&mut contract, argument);
//! ::near_sdk::env::state_write(&contract);
//! // Drop on `contract` is called! `IterableMap` is only `flush`-ed here  <====
//! // ...
//! ```
//!
//! ## General description
//!
//! These collections are more scalable versions of [`std::collections`] when used as contract
//! state because it allows values to be lazily loaded and stored based on what is actually
//! interacted with.
//!
//! Fundamentally, a contract's storage is a key/value store where both keys and values are just
//! [`Vec<u8>`]. If you want to store some structured data, for example, [`Vec<Account>`], one way
//! to achieve that would be to serialize the Vec to bytes and store that. This has a drawback in
//! that accessing or modifying a single element would require reading the whole `Vec` from the
//! storage.
//!
//! That's where `store` module helps. Its collections are backed by a key value store.
//! For example, a store::Vector is stored as several key-value pairs, where indices are the keys.
//! So, accessing a single element would only load this specific element.
//!
//! It's also a bad practice to have a native collection properties as a top level properties of your contract.
//! The contract will load all the properties before the contract method invocation. That means that all your native
//! collections will be fully loaded into memory even if they are not used in the method you invoke.
//!
//! It can be expensive to load all values into memory, and because of this, `serde`
//! [`Serialize`](serde::Serialize) and [`Deserialize`](serde::Deserialize) traits are
//! intentionally not implemented. If you want to return all values from a storage collection from
//! a function, consider using pagination with the collection iterators.
//!
//! All of the collections implement [`BorshSerialize`](borsh::BorshSerialize) and
//! [`BorshDeserialize`](borsh::BorshDeserialize) to be able to store the metadata of the
//! collections to be able to access all values. Because only metadata is serialized, these
//! structures should not be used as a borsh return value from a function.
//!
//! ## Calls to **host functions**, used in implementation:
//!
//! * [`near_sdk::env::storage_write`](crate::env::storage_write)
//! * [`near_sdk::env::storage_read`](crate::env::storage_read)
//! * [`near_sdk::env::storage_remove`](crate::env::storage_remove)
//! * [`near_sdk::env::storage_has_key`](crate::env::storage_has_key)
//!
//! ## Module's glossary:
//!
//! The collections are as follows:
//!
//! Sequences:
//!
//! - [`Vector`]: Analogous to [`Vec`] but not contiguous and persisted to storage.
//!
//! Maps:
//!
//! - [`LookupMap`]: Wrapper around key-value storage interactions, similar to
//!   [`UnorderedMap`]/[`std::collections::HashMap`] except that keys are not persisted and cannot be
//!   iterated over.
//!
//! - [`UnorderedMap`]: __DEPRECATED__ storage version of [`std::collections::HashMap`]. No ordering
//!   guarantees.
//! - [`IterableMap`]: a replacement with better iteration performance for [`UnorderedMap`], which is being deprecated.
//!
//! - [`TreeMap`] (`unstable`): Storage version of [`std::collections::BTreeMap`]. Ordered by key,
//!   which comes at the cost of more expensive lookups and iteration.
//!
//! Sets:
//!
//! - [`LookupSet`]: Non-iterable storage version of [`std::collections::HashSet`].
//!
//! - [`UnorderedSet`]: __DEPRECATED__ analogous to [`std::collections::HashSet`], and is an iterable
//!   version of [`LookupSet`] and persisted to storage.
//! - [`IterableSet`]: a replacement with better iteration performance for [`UnorderedSet`], which is being deprecated.
//!
//! Basic Types:
//!
//! - [`Lazy<T>`](Lazy): Lazily loaded type that can be used in place of a type `T`.
//!   Will only be loaded when interacted with and will persist on [`Drop`].
//!
//! - [`LazyOption<T>`](LazyOption): Lazily loaded, optional type that can be used in
//!   place of a type [`Option<T>`](Option). Will only be loaded when interacted with and will
//!   persist on [`Drop`].
//!
