    /// The `nft_transfer_call` process:
    ///
    /// 1. Sender calls `nft_transfer_call` on FT contract
    /// 2. NFT contract transfers token from sender to receiver
    /// 3. NFT contract calls `nft_on_transfer` on receiver contract
    /// 4+. [receiver contract may make other cross-contract calls]
    /// N. NFT contract resolves promise chain with `nft_resolve_transfer`, and may
    ///    transfer token back to sender
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    /// * Contract MUST forbid calls to this function by any account except self
    /// * If promise chain failed, contract MUST revert token transfer
    /// * If promise chain resolves with `true`, contract MUST return token to
    ///   `sender_id`
    ///
    /// Arguments:
    /// * `previous_owner_id`: the owner prior to the call to `nft_transfer_call`
    /// * `receiver_id`: the `receiver_id` argument given to `nft_transfer_call`
    /// * `token_id`: the `token_id` argument given to `ft_transfer_call`
    /// * `approved_account_ids`: if using Approval Management, contract MUST provide
    ///   set of original approved accounts in this argument, and restore these
    ///   approved accounts in case of revert.
    ///
    /// Returns true if token was successfully transferred to `receiver_id`.
