/// Trait used when it's desired to have a non-fungible token that has a
/// traditional escrow or approval system. This allows Alice to allow Bob
/// to take only the token with the unique identifier "19" but not others.
/// It should be noted that in the [core non-fungible token standard] there
/// is a method to do "transfer and call" which may be preferred over using
/// an approval management standard in certain use cases.
