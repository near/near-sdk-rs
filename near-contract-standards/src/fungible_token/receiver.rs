    /// - The transferred amount was `500`, the contract completely takes it and must return `0`.

    ///   cancelled. The method must return `500` or panic.

    /// Arguments:
    /// - `sender_id` - the account ID that initiated the transfer.
    /// - `amount` - the amount of tokens that were transferred to this account in a decimal string representation.
    /// - `msg` - a string message that was passed with this transfer call.
    ///
    /// Returns the amount of unused tokens that should be returned to sender, in a decimal string representation.
