//! # near_sdk_sim
//!
//! This crate provides an interface for simulating transactions on NEAR's Blockchain.
//! The simulator uses a standalone runtime that can handle any of the [actions](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Actions.html) provided by the
//! real runtime, including: creating accounts, deploying contracts, making contract calls and
//! calling view methods.
