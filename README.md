## Release notes

**Release notes and unreleased changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)**

## Example. For more information, see the [`Attribute Macro near`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/attr.near.html) documentation

Wrap a struct in `#[near]` and it generates a smart contract compatible with the NEAR blockchain:
```rust
use near_sdk::{near, env};

#[near(contract_state)]
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct StatusMessage {
    records: HashMap<AccountId, String>,
}

#[near]
impl StatusMessage {
    pub fn set_status(&mut self, message: String) {
        let account_id = env::signer_account_id();
        self.records.insert(account_id, message);
    }

    pub fn get_status(&self, account_id: AccountId) -> Option<String> {
        self.records.get(&account_id).cloned()
    }
}
```

## Github Codespaces template + [an online ide](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/reference/using-the-vs-code-command-palette-in-codespaces)

* Quick start your project with the [template repository](https://github.com/near/cargo-near-new-project-template) generated by `cargo near new` command
* The associated [template repository](https://github.com/near/cargo-near-new-project-template)'s README contains a `Code > Codespaces > Create codespace on main` screenshot.
* Clicking the button will result in using [Github Codespaces devcontainer](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces). The containers allow you to start building without the need to install any dependencies on your machine and provide the actual version.

## Features

### Unit-testable
Writing unit tests is easy with `near-sdk`:

```rust
#[test]
fn set_get_message() {
    let mut contract = StatusMessage::default();
    contract.set_status("hello".to_string());
    assert_eq!("hello".to_string(), contract.get_status("bob_near".to_string()).unwrap());
}
```

Run unit test the usual way:
```sh
cargo test --package status-message
```

### Asynchronous cross-contract calls
Asynchronous cross-contract calls allow parallel execution of multiple contracts in parallel with subsequent aggregation on another contract. [`env`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/env/index.html) exposes the following methods:
* [`promise_create`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/env/fn.promise_create.html) -- schedules an execution of a function on some contract;
* [`promise_then`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/env/fn.promise_then.html) -- attaches the callback back to the current contract once the function is executed;
* [`promise_and`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/env/fn.promise_and.html) -- combinator, allows waiting on several promises simultaneously, before executing the callback;
* [`promise_return`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/env/fn.promise_return.html) -- treats the result of execution of the promise as the result of the current function.

Follow [examples/cross-contract-high-level](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/examples/cross-contract-calls/high-level)
to see various usages of cross contract calls, including **system-level actions** done from inside the contract like balance transfer (examples of other system-level actions are: account creation, access key creation/deletion, contract deployment, etc).

### Initialization methods
We can define an initialization method that can be used to initialize the state of the contract. `#[init]` verifies that the contract has not been initialized yet (the contract state doesn't exist) and will panic otherwise.

```rust
#[near]
impl StatusMessage {
    #[init]
    pub fn new(user: String, status: String) -> Self {
        let mut res = Self::default();
        res.records.insert(user, status);
        res
    }
}
```

Even if you have initialization method your smart contract is still expected to derive `Default` trait. If you don't
want to disable default initialization, then you can prohibit it like this:
```rust
impl Default for StatusMessage {
    fn default() -> Self {
        near_sdk::env::panic_str("Contract should be initialized before the usage.")
    }
}
```
You can also prohibit `Default` trait initialization by using `near_sdk::PanicOnDefault` helper macro. E.g.:
```rust
#[near(contract_state)]
#[derive(PanicOnDefault)]
pub struct StatusMessage {
    records: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

### Payable methods
We can allow methods to accept token transfer together with the function call. This is done so that contracts can define a fee in tokens that needs to be paid when they are used. By the default the methods are not payable and they will panic if someone will attempt to transfer tokens to them during the invocation. This is done for safety reason, in case someone accidentally transfers tokens during the function call.

To declare a payable method simply use `#[payable]` decorator:
```rust

#[payable]
pub fn my_method(&mut self) {
...
}
```

### Private methods
Usually, when a contract has to have a callback for a remote cross-contract call, this callback method should
only be called by the contract itself. It's to avoid someone else calling it and messing the state. Pretty common pattern
is to have an assert that validates that the direct caller (predecessor account ID) matches to the contract's account (current account ID).
Macro `#[private]` simplifies it, by making it a single line macro instead and improves readability.

To declare a private method use `#[private]` decorator:
```rust

#[private]
pub fn my_method(&mut self) {
...
}
/// Which is equivalent to

pub fn my_method(&mut self ) {
    if near_sdk::env::current_account_id() != near_sdk::env::predecessor_account_id() {
        near_sdk::env::panic_str("Method my_method is private");
    }
...
}
```

Now, only the account of the contract itself can call this method, either directly or through a promise.

## Pre-requisites
To develop Rust contracts you would need to:
* Install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
* Add wasm target to your toolchain:
```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Writing Rust Contract
You can follow the [examples/status-message](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/examples/status-message) crate that shows a simple Rust contract.

The general workflow is the following:
1. Create a crate and configure the `Cargo.toml` similarly to how it is configured in [examples/status-message/Cargo.toml](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/examples/status-message/Cargo.toml);
2. Crate needs to have one `pub` struct that will represent the smart contract itself:
    * The struct needs to implement `Default` trait which
    NEAR will use to create the initial state of the contract upon its first usage;

   Here is an example of a smart contract struct:
   ```rust
   use near_sdk::{near, env};

   #[near(contract_state)]
   #[derive(Default)]
   pub struct MyContract {
       data: HashMap<u64, u64>
   }
   ```

3. Define methods that NEAR will expose as smart contract methods:
    * You are free to define any methods for the struct but only public methods will be exposed as smart contract methods;
    * Methods need to use either `&self`, `&mut self`, or `self`;
    * Decorate the `impl` section with `#[near]` macro. That is where all the M.A.G.I.C. (Macros-Auto-Generated Injected Code) happens;
    * If you need to use blockchain interface, e.g. to get the current account id then you can access it with `env::*`;

    Here is an example of smart contract methods:
    ```rust
    #[near]
    impl MyContract {
        pub fn insert_data(&mut self, key: u64, value: u64) -> Option<u64> {
            self.data.insert(key)
        }
        pub fn get_data(&self, key: u64) -> Option<u64> {
            self.data.get(&key).cloned()
        }
    }
    ```

## Building Rust Contract

### [cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near)

`cargo-near` is an easy and recommended way to build and deploy Rust contracts.

#### Installation

<details>
  <summary>Install prebuilt binaries via shell script (Linux, macOS)</summary>

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/near/cargo-near/releases/latest/download/cargo-near-installer.sh | sh
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Install prebuilt binaries via powershell script (Windows)</summary>

```sh
irm https://github.com/near/cargo-near/releases/latest/download/cargo-near-installer.ps1 | iex
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Install prebuilt binaries into your Node.js application</summary>

```sh
npm install cargo-near
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Compile and install from source code (Cargo)</summary>

```sh
cargo install cargo-near
```

or, install the most recent version from git repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/near/cargo-near
$ cargo install --path cargo-near
```
</details>

#### Usage

See `cargo near --help` for a complete list of available commands or run `cargo near` to dive into interactive mode.
Help is also available for each individual command with a `--help` flag, e.g. `cargo near build --help`.

```sh
cargo near
```

Starts interactive mode that will allow to explore all the available commands.

```sh
cargo near build
```

Builds a NEAR smart contract along with its [ABI](https://github.com/near/abi) (while in the directory containing contract's Cargo.toml).

If you have problems/errors with schema/ABI during build that you cannot figure out quick, you can skip/circumvent them with:

```sh
cargo near build non-reproducible-wasm --no-abi
```

And return to figuring how to resolve problems with generating ABI of your contract later.

```sh
cargo near create-dev-account
```

Guides you through creation of a new NEAR account on [testnet](https://explorer.testnet.near.org).

```sh
cargo near deploy
```

Builds the smart contract (equivalent to `cargo near build`) and guides you to deploy it to the blockchain.

## NEAR contract standards

[`near-contract-standards` crate](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-contract-standards) provides a set of interfaces and implementations for NEAR's contract standards:

- Upgradability
- Fungible Token (NEP-141). See [example usage](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/examples/fungible-token)
- Non-Fungible Token (NEP-171). See [example usage](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/examples/non-fungible-token)


## Versioning

### Semantic Versioning

This crate follows [Cargo's semver guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html).

State breaking changes (low-level serialization format of any data type) will be avoided at all costs. If a change like this were to happen, it would come with a major version and come with a compiler error. If you encounter one that does not, [open an issue](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/issues/new)!

### MSRV

The minimum supported Rust version is currently `1.85`. There are no guarantees that this will be upheld if a security patch release needs to come in that requires a Rust toolchain increase.
