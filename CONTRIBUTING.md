### Commits

Please use descriptive PR titles. We loosely follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style, but this is not a requirement to follow exactly. PRs will be addressed more quickly if it is clear what the intention is.

### Before opening a PR

Ensure the following are satisfied before opening a PR:

- The `git-hooks.sh` script has been run to install the git hooks.
- Code is formatted with `rustfmt` by running `cargo fmt`
- Run all tests and linters with [./run-tests.sh](./run-tests.sh)
- Ensure any new functionality is adequately tested
- If any new public types or functions are added, ensure they have appropriate [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html) documentation
